Eager loading is noting but loading all the associated records using as few queries as possible.

Most of us heard about N + 1 query problem.

Letâ€™s assume we have 2 models as `User` and `Company`. As association as follows

```ruby
# models/user.rb

class User < ApplicationRecord
	has_one :company
end
```

```ruby
# models/comapny.rb
class Company < ApplicationRecord
	belongs_to :user
end
```

 Consider the following code, which finds all the users and prints the company name

```ruby
users = User.all

users.each do |user|
	puts user.company.name
end
```

Above code looks fine and in working condition. But we have problem of N + 1 query here.

The above code executes 1 (find all users) + N (one per each user to load company) = N + 1 queries.

Console output for above queries:

```ruby

  User Load (0.6ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"

### Solution to N + 1 queries problem:

We can use `.includes()` in order to solve N + 1 query problem.

The `includes` method eager loads all the associated records. Hence, no need to load associated records every time. No need to call or execute extra query each time when we call associated record.

Using includes in above code:

```ruby
users = User.incldues(:comapny)

users.each do |user|
	puts user.comapny.name
end
```

Output for above code:

```ruby
3.0.3 :010 > users = User.includes(:company)
  User Load (1.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
  Company Load (1.2ms)  SELECT "companies".* FROM "companies" WHERE "companies"."user_id" IN ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10)  [["user_id", 1], ["user_id", 2], ["user_id", 3], ["user_id", 4], ["user_id", 5], ["user_id", 6], ["user_id", 7], ["user_id", 8], ["user_id", 9], ["user_id", 10]]

3.0.3 :011 > user.each do |user|
3.0.3 :012 >   puts user.company.name

Note that only 2 queries are executed when we used includes method. In this way we can optimise performance of our rails application. ðŸ¥‚

Stay tuned for difference between `incldues`, `preload` and `eager_load`.
