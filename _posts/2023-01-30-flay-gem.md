This tutorial is regarding Flay gem helps you to avoid duplications and similarities in code to write a clean code

### Flay gem analyzes your code and returns the scope to refactor

 installation process :-

> gem install flay


or add below line in you Gemfile and bundle

> gem 'flay' 


after successfully installing the gem below command will give you output

> flay ./app


this command will process all the code and return you the result and score (lower is better)
suppose you have to run it for only controllers or models then you can specify it in the path in front of the flay

> flay ./app/models

> flay ./app/controllers


Output:-

The output will be like 
```ruby
Total score (lower is better) = 277
1) IDENTICAL code found in :defn (mass*2 = 64)
  ./app/something.rb:71
  ./app/somethin2.rb:79

2) Similar code found in:attrasgn (mass = 63)
  ./app/something.rb:71
  ./app/somethin2.rb:79
    ./app/somethin3.rb:89
```

So, above output tells that files have identical or similar code
Then on this finding, you can try to optimize the code of that particular file by using SOLID or DRY principles

Flay also have some extension of JS and ERB

- flay-actionpackUse Rails ERB handler.
- flay-jsProcess JavaScript files.
