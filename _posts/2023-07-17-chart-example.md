If you're looking to enhance your Next.js project with beautiful charts and design, the Chart.js library is a great choice. In this blog, we will explore how to integrate Chart.js into your Next.js project. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a Next.js project

To create a Next.js project, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

During the project creation process, you will be prompted to provide a project name and configure other settings. Here's an example of a configuration:

## Step 2: Import necessary packages

To use Chart.js in your Next.js project, install the required packages:

```bash
yarn add react-chartjs-2 chart.js
```

After adding the dependencies, you can import and use them as follows:

## Code

```jsx
import { Doughnut } from "react-chartjs-2";
import { Chart, ArcElement, CategoryScale, Tooltip, LinearScale } from 'chart.js'
Chart.register(ArcElement, CategoryScale, LinearScale, Tooltip);

const DoughnutChart = () => {
  const data = {
    labels: [
      'Red',
      'Blue',
      'Yellow'
    ],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'My First Dataset',
      data: [300, 50, 100],
      backgroundColor: [
        'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
        'rgb(54, 162, 235)',
        'rgb(255, 205, 86)'
      ],
      hoverOffset: 4
    }]
  };
  return <Doughnut data={data} />;
}

export default DoughnutChart;
```

The important part here is the **`Chart.register()`** function. Without registering the necessary elements, you might encounter an error stating **`Error: "arc" is not a registered element.`**

I've implemented a basic demo of the above code. You can check the live [DEMO](https://chart-example-publl9fl4-kalpitchoudhari.vercel.app/){:target="_blank"} here.
