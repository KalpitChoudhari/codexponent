# Streamline Your Error Monitoring with Airbrake Integration

Airbrake is a tool that provides you with tracking of errors in your application which

helps you to keep track of all the errors  basically it is a error notifier

Below are the steps to integrate the airbrake in your rails application

1. Create an Airbrake account and project

The first step in integrating Airbrake into your Rails application is to create an Airbrake account and project. This can be done by visiting the Airbrake website and signing up for an account. Once you have created your account, you will need to create a new project for your Rails application.

1. Install the Airbrake gem

Next, you will need to install the Airbrake gem in your Rails application. This can be done by adding the following line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'airbrake'
```

Then run **`bundle install`** to install the gem.

1. Configure the Airbrake gem

After installing the Airbrake gem, you will need to configure it to work with your Rails application. To do this, you will need to create an initializer file in your Rails application's **`config/initializers`** directory. Here's an example of what this file might look like:

```
Airbrake.configure do |config|
  config.project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
  config.project_key = 'YOUR_PROJECT_KEY'
  config.environment = Rails.env
  config.ignore_environments = %w(development test)
end
```

In this example, **`YOUR_PROJECT_ID`** and **`YOUR_PROJECT_KEY`** should be replaced with the project ID and project key for your Airbrake project. The **`environment`** option should be set to the current Rails environment, and the **`ignore_environments`** option should be set to any environments in which you don't want to track errors (e.g. development or test).

1. Test the integration

Once you have configured the Airbrake gem, you should test the integration to make sure that it is working properly.

you can raise a dummy error for it from a controller like 

```ruby
raise 'This is a test error!'
```

or 

You can run below rake task

```ruby
rake airbrake:test
```

1. Raise error in airbrake

To raise an error in Airbrake from your Rails application, you can use the **`notify`**
 method provided by the Airbrake gem. Here's an example of how to do this:

```ruby
begin
  # Your code here
  raise 'This is an error!'
rescue => e
  Airbrake.notify(e)
end
```

When you visit your application's URL and trigger this error, it should appear in your Airbrake project's error dashboard.

And that's it! By following these steps, you should now have Airbrake integrated into your Rails application and be able to monitor and track errors that occur in your application.
