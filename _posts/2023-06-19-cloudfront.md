What is Amazon CloudFront?

Amazon CloudFront is a global CDN service designed to deliver static, dynamic, and streaming content with low latency and high data transfer speeds. It acts as a middle layer between the origin server (such as an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance) and end users, caching content at edge locations worldwide for faster delivery.

Key Features and Benefits

Global Edge Locations: CloudFront has an extensive network of edge locations strategically distributed across the globe. These edge locations cache and serve content from nearby locations, reducing the round-trip time and improving performance.
Low Latency and High Data Transfer Speeds: By leveraging the edge locations, CloudFront minimizes latency and delivers content with impressive speed, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Scalability: CloudFront can handle traffic spikes and scale automatically to accommodate increasing demand, making it suitable for websites and applications of any size.
Customizable Content Delivery: CloudFront allows you to customize content delivery based on your needs. You can configure cache behaviors, set up origin failover, and use advanced features like Lambda@Edge for serverless content customization.
